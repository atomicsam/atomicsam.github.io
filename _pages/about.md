Hi there, I'm Sam and I'm currently studying Computing Science at the University of Glasgow.

During my time here I have been able to greatly increase my knowledge of both how computers operate as well as how to create higher quality software. Some topics that we have covered include: Networks, Operating Systems, Algorithms & Datastructures, Web Application Development, Design Patterns, etc.

Outside of University I try to spend my time productively, and such have taken up interesting hobbies such as Photography, Cycling, Reading, Cooking, Learning Japanese, etc.
